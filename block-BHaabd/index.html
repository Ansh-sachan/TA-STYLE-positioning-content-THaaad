            <h2>Usefulness of Cats</h2>
            <img src="image1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>in our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries ,in our kitchens and stoerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they are! in our ships,however, the rats oft set them at defiance; still they are of grat service.</p>
            <br>
            <p>how wonderfullypatient is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from the place of refuge or what which is their home! How well Shakespeare in pericles,act iii.,describes this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now crouches from (before)the mouse's hole  </p>
            <br>
            <p> A sight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as i once had, and let them be deliverd therefrom by cats, as i was,and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.</p> <br>
